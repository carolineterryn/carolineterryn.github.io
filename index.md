# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! On these repo, I have a variety of projects that I 
have been working on over the past few years at Northwestern University. 
These range from software development in C, C++, Python, ROS, and MATLAB to 
machining and mechanical design. I hope you enjoy browsing!
