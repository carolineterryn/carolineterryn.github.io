## Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! On this website, I have a variety of projects that I 
have been working on over the past few years at Northwestern University. 
These range from software development and embedded systems in C, C++, Python, ROS, 
and MATLAB to machining and mechanical design. I hope you enjoy browsing!

### The Poolinator
As a team, we programmed the Franka Emika Robot (FER) to play a game of pool on a tabletop pool set.
The FER will continue to attempt to knock the blue balls into a pocket until the red ball gets knocked
into a pocket or when all of the balls have been cleared off the table.
